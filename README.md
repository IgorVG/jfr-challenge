# JFR-Hackhathon
Annual challenge organised by the french association of radiologists. In 2019 editions that took place from 14/09 to 13/10, teams were presented with x3 datasets:
1. TC images of lungs for cancer nodules detection (classification)
2. TC images of lungs for multiple sclerosis level prediction (score prediction 1-20 range with 0.5 step)
3. Calculation of the muscle surface for sarcopenia (segmentation)
Present notebooks are a part of lung cancer classification project.

Learning dataset consisted of ~650 3D DICOM images with an typical resolution of 512x512x350 pixels.
An example of normalized 2D slice from one for 3D image:
